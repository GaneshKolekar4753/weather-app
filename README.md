# Weather App

A responsive weather application built using React that displays the current weather for your current location or a specified location. The app uses the WeatherAPI to fetch weather data and includes animated graphics to represent different weather conditions.

## Features

- **Current Location Weather**: Automatically fetches and displays weather information for your current location (requires location permissions).
- **Search by Location**: Allows users to search for weather information by entering a city name or coordinates.
- **Last Known Location**: Remembers the last searched location and displays its weather on the next visit.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Weather Animations**: Displays CSS animations for different weather conditions (e.g., rain, sunny, cloud).
